## Installing SQLite Locally

I use Homebrew to install my packages. All you need to do is:

```
brew install sqlite3
```

You can also get the pre-combined files from the SQLite website. You should be looking at the SQLite Amalgamation for whichever operating system or platform you use.

Mac Users: the version of SQLite that comes installed by default does not permit the addition of extensions. The usage of the homebrew version or the amalgamation from the official website is highly recommended.
